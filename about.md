# About

![image](/assets/till.jpeg){: style="float: left; max-width: 25%; border-radius: 5px; margin-right: 1em;"}

I am a Research Associate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) where I work with [JP Onnela](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/) to monitor public health using operational healthcare data and develop inference methods for agent-based models. My research connects models with complex, often messy real-world datasets, such as data not originally intended for research purposes. I am particularly interested in open and reproducible science based on data that adheres to the principle of privacy by designâ€”without compromising the insights we can glean.

Before joining the Onnela lab, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics), Staff Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com), and Principal Research Scientist at [Sonalytic](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/spotify-acquires-audio-detection-startup-sonalytic/). I received my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of [Nick S. Jones](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones) and Master of Physics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk).
