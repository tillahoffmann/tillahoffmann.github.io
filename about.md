# About

<div class="media">
    <div class="media-body">
        I am a PhD student in the mathematics department at Imperial College London. My interests lie in building Bayesian models for large-scale social networks to better understand how people connect with one another given their demographic background. I am also a Principal Research Scientist at <a href="http://www.sonalytic.com/">Sonalytic</a> where I build machine learning algorithms to identify, monitor and discover music.
