# About

<div class="media">
    <div class="media-body">
        I am a PhD student in the mathematics department at Imperial College London. I am interested in social networks and am trying to understand how people connect with one another depending on their demographic backgrounds. I am also interested in time series data such as audio and financial data. In my spare time, I kayak and go rock climbing.
