I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Mathematics Department at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/) and an Academic Visitor in the [Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/ociam), where I work with [Nick Jones](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones/research.html) and [Renaud Lambiotte](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/renaud.lambiotte), respectively. My academic work is concerned with the structure of large networks, such as social or communication networks, dynamics unfolding on networks, and inference techniques that allow us to learn as much as possible about social networks without compromising the privacy of individuals.

More recently, I have started developing generative models for wastewater-based epidemiology as part of the [Envirology project](https://envirology.github.io/) where I am a RCoI. Prior to joining the project, I was a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify, where I focus on building large-scale content analysis pipelines to enrich the Spotify catalogue
