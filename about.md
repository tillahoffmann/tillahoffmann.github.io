I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) where I work with [JP Onnela](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/) to build models for networks and study their effect on disease transmission. My research connects network models with complex real-world datasets, such as indirect or partial observations of networks. I am particularly interested in open and reproducible science based on data that adheres to the principle of privacy by designâ€”without compromising the insights we can glean.

Before joining the Onnela lab, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics), Staff Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com), and Principal Research Scientist at [Sonalytic](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/spotify-acquires-audio-detection-startup-sonalytic/). I received my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of [Nick S. Jones](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nick.jones) and master's from the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk).
