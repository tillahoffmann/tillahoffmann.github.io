# Research

Quantifying biomarkers in wastewater to monitor public health---known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)---rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. But data are *very* noisy, and the potential of WBE as a cost-effective, equitable public health monitoring tool remains unrealized.

Realizing WBE's potential to monitor public health and inform policy requires that we build models for principled uncertainty quantification of epidemiologically relevant quantities. I both develop foundational methods for scalable Bayesian inference and apply them to address concrete WBE challenges together with interdisciplinary collaborators.

In my methodological work, I developed model-based time series clustering algorithms ([Hoffmann, Peel, Lambiotte, and Jones, 2020]({% post_url 2020-01-24-community-detection-without-observing-edges %})), a high-performance inference library for Gaussian processes using Stan ([Hoffmann and Onnela, 2023]({% post_url 2023-01-24-gptools-stan %})), and neural networks to extract summary statistics from complex data for simulation-based inference ([Hoffmann and Onnela, 2022]({% post_url 2022-06-06-minimizing-expected-posterior-entropy %})).

In my applied work, I initiated a collaboration to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater to estimate community prevalence, securing more than $850,000 in funding across three grants. I developed models for fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA which allowed us to resolve tension between WBE and clinical data, demonstrate that all people likely shed viral RNA in their feces, and show that WBE can be a leading indicator ([Hoffmann and Alsing, 2023]({% post_url 2023-03-17-faecal-shedding-models %})). I also advised the UK Health Security Agency (akin to the CDC) on the management and analysis of WBE data ([Hoffmann, McIntyre-Nolan et al., 2021]({% post_url 2021-04-08-current-environmental-monitoring-cannot %})), contributed to a characterization of sources of uncertainty in WBE ([Wade et al., 2022]({% post_url 2022-02-15-understanding-and-managing-uncertainty %})), and published the first comprehensive dataset of wastewater catchment areas in Great Britain ([Hoffmann, Bunney, Kasprzyk-Hordern, Singer, 2022]({% post_url 2022-02-25-wastewater-catchment-areas %})).
