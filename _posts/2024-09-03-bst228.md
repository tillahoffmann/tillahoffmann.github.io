title: "BST228: Applied Bayesian Analysis"
---

BST228 Applied Bayesian Analysis is a practical introduction to the Bayesian analysis of biomedical data taught in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) taught by [Prof Stephenson](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/briana-stephenson/) and Dr Hoffmann. It is an intermediate graduate-level course in the philosophy, analytic strategies, implementation, and interpretation of Bayesian data analysis. Specific topics that will be covered include: the Bayesian paradigm; Bayesian analysis of basic models; Markov Chain Monte Carlo for posterior inference; Stan R software package for Bayesian data analysis; linear regression; hierarchical regression models; generalized linear models; meta-analysis; models for missing data.
