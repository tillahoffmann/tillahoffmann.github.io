The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well established, posing challenges for wastewater-based surveillance of COVID-19 and risk assessments of environmental transmission. We develop versatile hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and apply them to data collected in six studies. We find that the mean number of gene copies per mL of faeces is $1.9\times10^{6}$ ($2.3\times10^{5}-2.0\times10^{8}$ 95% credible interval) amongst hospitalised patients. We find no evidence for a subpopulation of patients who do not shed RNA: limits of quantification can account for negative stool samples. Our models indicate that hospitalised patients represent the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of $34$ hours ($28-43$ 95% credible interval), suggesting that wastewater-based surveillance signals are more indicative of incidence than prevalence and can be a leading indicator of clinical presentation. Shedding amongst inpatients cannot explain high RNA concentrations observed in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.
