The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces is not well characterised, posing challenges for quantitative wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). We developed hierarchical models for faecal RNA shedding and fitted them to data from six studies. A mean concentration of 1.9×10⁶ mL⁻¹ (2.3×10⁵–2.0×10⁸ 95% credible interval) was found among unvaccinated inpatients, not considering differences in shedding between viral variants. Limits of quantification could account for negative samples based on Bayesian model comparison. Inpatients represented the tail of the shedding profile with a half-life of 34 hours (28–43 95% credible interval), suggesting that WBE can be a leading indicator for clinical presentation. Shedding among inpatients could not explain the high RNA concentrations found in wastewater, consistent with more abundant shedding during the early infection course.
