Writing documentation for a project with consistent formatting is tedious and not particularly stimulating. I wrote an IPython `magic` to generate `docstring` stubs in line with [this `numpy` example](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/example.py). You can find a working notebook on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/tillahoffmann/1c0b07889d07c8904cd5).
