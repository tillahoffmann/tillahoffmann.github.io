title: Biomarker Shedding at the Institute for Disease Modeling Symposium
---

[Yuke Wang](https://ywan446.github.io) and I presented our work on biomarker shedding at the [Institute for Disease Modeling Symposium](https://www.idmod.org/symposium/current-symposium/) hosted by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org) in Seattle, WA.

Yuke introduced the [Shedding Hub](https://shedding-hub.github.io), a central repository of biomarker shedding data. Together with a team of five students at Emory University, we are extracting shedding data from peer-reviewed publications to validate and make these data accessible. Data from the repository will be able to inform models for wastewater-based epidemiology and may also provide clinical insights, e.g., if SARS-CoV-2 causes enteric infections among some patients. We love data contributions ❤️; submit yours as a pull request on GitHub [here](https://github.com/shedding-hub/shedding-hub)!

I presented our work on [fecal shedding models for SARS-CoV-2 RNA]({% post_url 2023-03-17-faecal-shedding-models %}). In the publication, we highlight the importance of carefully modeling data from biomarker shedding studies because simple summary statistics are not sufficient to reliably analyze the data.
