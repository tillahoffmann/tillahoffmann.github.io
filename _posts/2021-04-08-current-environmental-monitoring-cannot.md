This paper presents summary statistics of wastewater data and a Bayesian hierarchical log-linear regression model developed to predict weekly COVID-19 case rates (NHS Pillar 1 and 2) based on wastewater surveillance data. Outputs are analysed to investigate whether the AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in addition to preventing symptomatic disease. No significant deviation was observed between reported case rates and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater. However, three confounding factors have been identified that limit the interpretation of this analysis: changes in NPI, the emergence of B.1.1.7, and a change in laboratory methodology. Therefore, the results presented in this paper cannot be considered evidence of COVID-19 vaccines preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While the insight provided by wastewater in interrogating the impact of vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is limited, the Environmental Monitoring for Health protection programme has, and will continue to, provide surveillance and outbreak support in the COVID-19 response.
