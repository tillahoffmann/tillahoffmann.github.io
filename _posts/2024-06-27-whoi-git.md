---

Based on the popular [Software Carpentries project](https://software-carpentry.org), [Ariel Vardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-vardi-334423ba/), [Karen Soenen](https://directory.whoi.edu/profile/ksoenen/), and I delivered a two-day workshop for fifty graduate students and research staff at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu). Slides from my presentation on using the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for reproducible data science are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sd-GJM5_-f1PlZKfi50Fn-6Q1eoFJTGKA2aLrZC-gCE/edit).
